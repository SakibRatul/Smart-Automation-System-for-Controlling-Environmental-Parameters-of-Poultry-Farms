The Smart Automation System for Controlling Environmental Parameters of Poultry Farms aims to automate the monitoring and regulation of key environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality. This system uses microcontroller-based technology and sensors to ensure optimal conditions in poultry farms, reducing manual intervention while improving farm productivity and poultry health. By leveraging real-time data, the system can make informed adjustments to ventilation, heating, and cooling, enhancing poultry growth rates and minimizing energy costs.
